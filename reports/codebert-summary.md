# Java Code Summaries

File: java/com/example/PolicyManagementJSP/LegacyServlet.java
Summary: This Java code defines a servlet named `LegacyServlet` that handles requests related to legacy policy management. The servlet establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database upon initialization and provides functionality to display a legacy policy management page and generate a policy report based on user input.

The servlet listens for requests with the URL pattern "/legacy" and handles GET requests by either displaying the legacy page or generating a policy report based on the action parameter provided in the request.

The `showLegacyPage` method generates an HTML form for users to input start and end dates to generate a policy report. The `generateReport` method executes a SQL query to retrieve policy data from the database based on the provided dates and displays the results in an HTML table.

Architecturally, the code demonstrates the use of servlets to handle web requests and interact with a database. However, there are some security concerns present in the code:
1. The database credentials (DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD) are hardcoded in the servlet, which is not recommended for security reasons. Storing sensitive information in code can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
2. The code uses plain JDBC to interact with the database, which can be prone to SQL injection attacks if user input is not properly sanitized. Using prepared statements with parameterized queries can help mitigate this risk.
3. The servlet does not implement any form of input validation or sanitization, which could expose the application to various security threats.

To enhance security, consider implementing secure coding practices such as using environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism to store sensitive information, validating and sanitizing user input, and implementing proper error handling to prevent information leakage.

File: java/com/example/PolicyManagementJSP/PolicyServlet.java
Summary: This Java code defines a servlet named `PolicyServlet` that handles HTTP requests related to policy management. The servlet establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database during initialization and closes the connection when destroyed. It provides functionality to list all policies or view a specific policy based on the requested action.

The servlet uses JDBC to interact with the database, executing queries to retrieve policy information. It populates `Policy` objects with data fetched from the database and forwards the data to JSP pages for rendering.

Architecturally, the code follows the standard servlet structure and separates database operations into methods for better organization. However, there are some security concerns in the code, such as hardcoding the database credentials in the servlet, which should be stored securely and accessed through configuration files or environment variables. Additionally, the code could benefit from input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks, especially when processing user input like policy IDs.

Overall, the code implements a basic policy management system using servlets and JDBC, but it would benefit from improvements in security practices and separation of concerns.

File: java/com/example/PolicyManagementJSP/Policy.java
Summary: This Java code defines a class named `Policy` within the `com.example.PolicyManagementJSP` package. The `Policy` class has private fields for storing an ID, policy number, customer name, start date, and end date. It also includes getter and setter methods for accessing and updating these fields.

The purpose of this class is to represent a policy entity, likely used in a policy management system. It encapsulates the basic information related to a policy, such as its identification, associated customer, and validity period.

From an architectural perspective, this class follows basic Java bean conventions by providing getters and setters for its private fields. However, there are no additional methods or business logic included in this class, which might be a concern depending on the overall design of the system.

In terms of security concerns, storing sensitive information like customer names in plain text fields could pose a risk if not handled securely. It is important to consider data encryption and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data within the system. Additionally, input validation and proper error handling should be implemented to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks when interacting with a database using the `Date` fields.
