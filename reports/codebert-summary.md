Summary: java/com/example/PolicyManagementJSP/LegacyServlet.java is a Java class. It implements a servlet to handle HTTP requests and responses, indicating a legacy web architecture. Migrate to Spring Boot REST APIs for modern scalability. It uses raw JDBC for database operations, which is error-prone. Adopt Spring Data JPA with Neon for modern ORM. It uses outdated logging (e.g., System.out or Log4j). Switch to SLF4J with Logback for better logging. It may contain hardcoded credentials, posing a security risk. Use environment variables with Spring Security.
