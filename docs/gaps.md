# Modernization Gaps

- - Gap: Servlet-based architecture detected.
Recommendation: Migrate to Spring Boot REST APIs.
- - Gap: Raw JDBC usage.
Recommendation: Use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- - Gap: JSP-based UI rendering.
Recommendation: Adopt modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular.
- - Gap: Outdated PostgreSQL JDBC driver version.
Recommendation: Update to the latest JDBC driver version for better performance and security.
- - Gap: Lack of input validation in servlets and JSP.
Recommendation: Implement input validation using modern validation frameworks or libraries.
- - Gap: Hardcoded database credentials.
Recommendation: Use environment variables or configuration files for storing sensitive information.
- - Gap: No separation of concerns between data access and business logic.
Recommendation: Implement a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns using Spring framework.
- - Gap: Lack of unit tests for servlets and JSP pages.
Recommendation: Implement unit tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to ensure code quality and reliability.
