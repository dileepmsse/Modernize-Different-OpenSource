# Modernization Gaps

- - Gap: Servlet-based architecture with direct JDBC connections detected.
Recommendation: Refactor servlets to RESTful services using Spring Boot and implement data access using Spring Data JPA to abstract database operations.
- - Gap: Direct JDBC usage in servlets for database operations.
Recommendation: Refactor database operations to use Spring Data JPA repositories for abstraction and improved maintainability.
- - Gap: JSP-based UI rendering for policy management.
Recommendation: Transition to modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular for improved user experience and maintainability.
- - Gap: Lack of separation of concerns in servlets handling both business logic and presentation.
Recommendation: Implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern by separating concerns into distinct layers for better code organization and maintainability.
