# Modernization Gaps

- - Gap: Raw JDBC usage. 
Recommendation: Switch to Spring JDBC or Hibernate for database interactions.
- - Gap: Servlet-based architecture detected. 
Recommendation: Refactor servlets to use Spring MVC for better structure and maintainability.
- - Gap: JSP-based UI rendering. 
Recommendation: Transition to frontend frameworks like React or Angular for improved user experience and scalability.
- - Gap: Outdated PostgreSQL JDBC driver. 
Recommendation: Update to the latest version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver for better performance and security.
- - Gap: Lack of input validation in servlets. 
Recommendation: Implement input validation using validation frameworks like Hibernate Validator or Spring Validation.
