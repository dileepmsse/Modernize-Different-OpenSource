# Modernization Gaps

- - Gap: Servlet-based architecture detected.
Recommendation: Migrate servlets to Spring Boot REST APIs for improved maintainability and scalability.
- - Gap: Raw JDBC usage.
Recommendation: Refactor JDBC code to use Spring Data JPA for easier database interaction and better abstraction.
- - Gap: JSP-based UI rendering.
Recommendation: Transition from JSP to modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular for more dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- - Gap: Outdated PostgreSQL JDBC driver version.
Recommendation: Upgrade to the latest version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver for improved performance and compatibility.
- - Gap: Lack of input validation in servlets.
Recommendation: Implement input validation mechanisms to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks.
- - Gap: Hardcoded database credentials in servlets.
Recommendation: Securely store database credentials and other sensitive information using environment variables or a configuration management tool.
- - Gap: Code duplication in servlets.
Recommendation: Refactor common code into reusable components or services to reduce duplication and improve code maintainability.
- - Gap: Missing unit tests for servlets and Java classes.
Recommendation: Implement unit tests using testing frameworks like JUnit to ensure code reliability and facilitate future refactoring efforts.
