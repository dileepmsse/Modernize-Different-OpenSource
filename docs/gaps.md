# Modernization Gaps

- Gap: Servlet-based architecture detected. Recommendation: Migrate to Spring Boot REST APIs.
- Gap: Raw JDBC usage. Recommendation: Use Spring Data JPA with Neon.
- Gap: JSP-based UI rendering. Recommendation: Adopt React or Angular.
- Gap: Outdated PostgreSQL JDBC driver used. Recommendation: Upgrade to the latest JDBC driver for PostgreSQL.
- Gap: Lack of separation of concerns between servlets and business logic. Recommendation: Implement a layered architecture using Spring framework.
- Gap: Manual database connection handling in servlets. Recommendation: Use connection pooling with frameworks like HikariCP.
- Gap: Limited testability due to tightly coupled servlets. Recommendation: Implement unit tests and move business logic to separate service classes.
- Gap: Lack of security mechanisms in servlets. Recommendation: Implement security features using Spring Security.
- Gap: Lack of error handling and logging in servlets. Recommendation: Implement robust error handling and logging using SLF4J with Logback.
- Gap: Absence of RESTful design principles in servlets. Recommendation: Refactor APIs to adhere to RESTful design principles using Spring Boot.
