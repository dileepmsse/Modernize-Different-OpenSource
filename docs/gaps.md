# Modernization Gaps

- - Gap: Servlet-based architecture detected.
Recommendation: Migrate servlets to Spring Boot REST APIs for improved maintainability and scalability.
- - Gap: Raw JDBC usage.
Recommendation: Refactor to use Spring Data JPA for easier database interactions and to leverage ORM capabilities.
- - Gap: JSP views for UI rendering.
Recommendation: Transition to modern front-end frameworks like React or Angular for a more dynamic and responsive user interface.
- - Gap: Outdated PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
Recommendation: Update to the latest version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver for improved performance and compatibility.
- - Gap: Lack of input validation in servlets.
Recommendation: Implement input validation mechanisms to prevent security vulnerabilities and data inconsistencies.
