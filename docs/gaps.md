# Modernization Gaps

- Gap: Servlet-based architecture with raw JDBC usage detected.
Recommendation: Migrate to a modern web framework like Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA for database access.
- 

Gap: Direct database connections in servlets.
Recommendation: Implement data access layer using Spring Data JPA to separate concerns.
- 

Gap: Lack of separation of concerns between servlets and business logic.
Recommendation: Refactor code to follow MVC pattern, separating presentation (servlets) from business logic.
- 

Gap: Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities due to manual query construction in servlets.
Recommendation: Use parameterized queries or an ORM framework like Hibernate to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- 

Gap: HTML generation in servlets.
Recommendation: Separate UI concerns by adopting a frontend framework like React or Angular and using REST APIs for data retrieval.
- 

Gap: Lack of error handling and logging.
Recommendation: Implement centralized error handling and logging using a modern logging framework like SLF4J with Logback.
- 

Gap: Absence of unit tests for servlets and database operations.
Recommendation: Implement unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
